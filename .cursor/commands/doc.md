There are three primary documentation files in the `CleanDocs/` directory that should be kept up-to-date:
- `clean_encyclopedia.md` - Comprehensive user documentation covering all features, workflows, and usage instructions. Update this when adding new user-facing features or changing existing functionality.
- `clean_TECHNICAL_OVERVIEW.md` - Technical documentation for developers including architecture, implementation details, and system design. Update this when adding new technical components or changing architectural patterns.
- `clean_readme.md` - Quick start guide and project overview. Update this for installation changes or major feature additions.

It doesnt matter what step or phase the action was, state how it works rather then when it was done
on completion, update the files in the `CleanDocs/` directory.
do not use date stamps or things like "NEW", "UPDATED", "CHANGED", etc.
just update the files.
if there are no changes, do not update the files.
if the changes you have just made change teh function of the code, update the files appropriately.

Ensure that the style and syntax of the files are consistent with the existing files.
be succint with any code examples.
make sure the updates go in the right sections of the files.
the files are long so make sure you dont miss anything.
