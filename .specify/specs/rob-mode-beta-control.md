# Feature Specification: Rob Mode - Beta Feature Control

**Feature Branch**: `feature/rob-mode-beta-control`
**Created**: 2025-09-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Review all the CleanDocs/clean_TECHNICAL_OVERVIEW.md CleanDocs/clean_encyclopedia.md. The point now is to finalize the code and hide some of the beta functions behind a 'Rob Mode'. There are no credentials. There is just a subtle link that opens up the beta data"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extracted: Need to hide beta features behind "Rob Mode" with subtle activation
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: beta features, subtle activation link, no authentication required
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow established for feature toggling
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable
   ‚Üí Ambiguous requirements marked
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties - specific beta features not defined"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a power user or developer of Simple Data Checker, I want to access advanced beta features through a discreet activation mechanism called "Rob Mode" so that production users have a stable experience while I can test and use experimental capabilities. The activation should be subtle - not obvious to casual users - and require no authentication or password.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a standard user viewing the application interface, **When** they use the application normally, **Then** they should not see any beta features or obvious indicators of Rob Mode
2. **Given** a user who knows about Rob Mode, **When** they click the subtle activation link, **Then** Rob Mode is enabled and beta features become visible
3. **Given** Rob Mode is enabled, **When** the user refreshes the page, **Then** Rob Mode state should persist for the current session
4. **Given** Rob Mode is enabled, **When** the user clicks the subtle link again (or a disable option), **Then** Rob Mode is deactivated and beta features are hidden
5. **Given** Rob Mode is enabled, **When** the user closes the browser/session, **Then** Rob Mode should be disabled for the next session

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user accidentally discovers the subtle link?
- How does the system handle Rob Mode state when switching between different pages?
- What occurs if beta features have errors - are they isolated from production features?
- How is Rob Mode state handled in multiple concurrent browser tabs?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a subtle activation link at the bottom of the navigation panel
- **FR-002**: System MUST NOT require any authentication, passwords, or credentials to activate Rob Mode
- **FR-003**: System MUST hide the following beta features from the navigation panel when Rob Mode is disabled:
    - Analytics Debug Workstation (`/bond/debug`)
    - Hull-White Monte Carlo OAS calculations and tools
    - Advanced mathematical models and enhancements
    - Test data generation tools (`generate_hull_white_market_data.py`, etc.)
    - Developer diagnostic utilities
    - Experimental API endpoints
- **FR-004**: System MUST control beta feature visibility by simply not showing their navigation links when Rob Mode is disabled
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain Rob Mode state within a browser session using session storage or cookies
- **FR-006**: System MUST automatically disable Rob Mode when a new session starts (security by default)
- **FR-007**: Beta features accessed through Rob Mode MUST be clearly marked as experimental (e.g., "BETA" badge or text indicator)
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a way to deactivate Rob Mode once activated (toggle behavior via the same link)
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure beta feature errors don't crash or affect core production features
- **FR-010**: System MUST log Rob Mode activations for usage analytics (without user identification)
- **FR-011**: The activation link MUST be positioned at the bottom of the navigation panel as a subtle, unobtrusive element
- **FR-012**: System MUST use `settings.yaml` to configure which features are considered "beta" and hidden behind Rob Mode

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Rob Mode State**: Session-based flag indicating whether beta features are accessible
- **Beta Feature Registry**: Configuration in `settings.yaml` defining which navigation items are considered beta
- **Activation Link**: Subtle link at bottom of navigation panel that toggles Rob Mode
- **Session Storage**: Browser storage mechanism for maintaining Rob Mode state
- **Navigation Configuration**: Dynamic navigation menu that shows/hides items based on Rob Mode state

## Review & Acceptance Checklist
*GATE: Automated checks run during main() execution*

### Content Quality
- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

### Requirement Completeness

### ‚úÖ Clarifications Resolved
1. **Specific Beta Features**: Confirmed - hide navigation links for Analytics Debug Workstation, Hull-White tools, test data generators, and developer utilities
2. **Activation Mechanism**: Subtle link at the bottom of the navigation panel
3. **Visual Indication**: Simply showing/hiding navigation links is sufficient - no additional indicators needed
4. **Feature Configuration**: Use `settings.yaml` for configuration of beta features
5. **Implementation**: Hide features by not showing their navigation links when Rob Mode is disabled

## Additional Context from Documentation Review

Based on review of the technical documentation, potential beta features that could be hidden behind Rob Mode include:

### Advanced Analytics & Debug Tools
1. **Analytics Debug Workstation** (`/bond/debug`)
   - 7-panel full-screen interface
   - Smart diagnostics with AI-powered analysis
   - Advanced sensitivity analysis
   - Goal seek and scenario modeling

2. **Hull-White Monte Carlo Models**
   - Institutional-grade OAS calculations
   - Advanced mathematical models
   - Calibration and testing tools

3. **Developer & Testing Utilities**
   - `generate_hull_white_market_data.py`
   - `diagnose_zspread_diff.py`
   - `verify_synth_vs_comprehensive.py`
   - `test_institutional_excel_validator.py`
   - Real-time performance monitoring dashboards

4. **Experimental Features**
   - Enhanced Excel workbook generation (21-sheet institutional version)
   - Advanced curve construction methods
   - Higher-order Greeks calculations
   - Multi-curve framework tools

5. **Data Generation & Testing**
   - Synthetic data generators
   - Market data simulators
   - Bulk testing utilities
   - Performance profiling tools

### Implementation Approach (Confirmed)
The implementation will be straightforward:
1. **Activation**: A subtle link at the bottom of the navigation panel (e.g., small text like "..." or "‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢" or even just ".")
2. **Configuration**: Beta features listed in `settings.yaml` under a `rob_mode_features` section
3. **Behavior**: When Rob Mode is off, beta navigation items are simply not rendered
4. **State Management**: Session storage to maintain state during browser session
5. **No Visual Clutter**: No additional indicators needed - the presence/absence of navigation items is sufficient
