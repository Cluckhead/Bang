# Purpose: Makes the 'views' directory a Python package and can be used for blueprint imports.
# No functions defined in this file.

# You can leave this file empty or use it to import blueprints
# for easier registration in the app factory, though explicit imports
# in the factory as done currently are also perfectly fine.
